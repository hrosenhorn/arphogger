Quick and dirty ARP Proxy for specific needs.

Not all routing solutions needs to be clean and pretty. This small program was written to solve a 
frustrating but simple problem due to buggy firmware.

Our ISP provided us with a IP range and instead of routing the network to us all addresses where up for grabs
by setting the IP on a machine.

This became a problem when we had machines standing behind a Watchguard, running in drop-in mode would forget it's arp entries.
By setting the mode to routed in our Watchguard and running this program on a separate machine,
responding to all arp requests and then routing all addresses using iptables we bypassed the problem.

:: Build and run ::
* Edit raw.h and update ETHMAC and GATEWAYIP 
* Type make to build
* ./hogger to run


::Other:: 
This could probably be solved using any arp proxy, or using hardware with working firmware. 
Sometimes you just need to write some code.
